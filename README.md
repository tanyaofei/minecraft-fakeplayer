## Features

+ Lets you spawn fake players who look like real to the server, they can keep chunk loading
+ Fake players can be recolonized by vanilla commands and plugin commands, such as `/ban`, `/tp`
+ You can open and edit their inventory via `/fp invsee` or Right-Clicking on them
+ You can fully control their moving, jumping, attacking... What's better ? Make it periodical
+ Each player can configure his personal configuration

## Requirements

+ [Paper](https://papermc.io) or [Purpur](http://purpurmc.org) software
+ [CommandAPI](https://commandapi.jorel.dev) Plugin (Any version **except** `10.0.0`)

## Config file

**Fakeplayer only generates a template config file named `config.tmpl.yml`.**
You need to rename this file to `config.yml` as your configuration file.
This approach can let you preview new content when you are upgrading it.

## Placeholder Variables

+ `%fakeplayer_total%`: Total count of fake players
+ `%fakeplayer_creator%`: The creator name of a fake player
+ `%fakeplayer_actions%`: Active actions of a fake player such as : `USE|ATTACK`

# Custom Translation

1. Create a `message` folder in `plugins/fakeplayer`
2. Copy [this file](fakeplayer-core/src/main/resources/message/message.properties) to `message` folder
3. Rename the file to `message_language_region.properties` such as `message_en_us.properties`
4. Edit your `config.yml`, set `i18n.locale` to the name suffix which you just created such as `en_us`
5. Type `/fp reload-translation` to reload translation file. If you change `i18n.local`, you should `/fp reload` first

**Make sure the translation file is encoded with UTF-8**

# FAQs

## xxx lost connection: PacketEvents 2.0 failed to inject

Some plugin changes the `Connection` of the fake player, You can set `prevent-kicking` to `ALWAYS` to solve it.

```yaml
# config.yml
prevent-kicking: ALWAYS
```

## Fake players do not attract aggression

By default, fake players are in invincible mode. Players need to manually turn off invincible mode with `/fp config set invulnerable false` to attract aggression. After turning it off, they will
receive hunger and health effects. You may need to use `res` or beacon to ensure the fake player's `hunger` and `health`.

## Fake players automatically log out after a while

This may be because plugins like `AutheMe` detect that fake players have not logged in for a long time. You can include the login command in the configuration file's `self-commands` to prevent the
plugin from kicking out players for being idle:

```yaml
# Note: You should use a complex password, or AuthMe may reject it
self-commands:
  - '/register abc123! abc123!'
  - '/login abc123!'
```
